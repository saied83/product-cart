###I had limited time to work on this project, as I first came across it on December 20th around 5:00 PM. With only 3 hours left until the deadline, I could only design the page using HTML and JavaScript. Today, I added JavaScript functionality to the project (HTML version). Please use a live server for previewing it.

###I hope my submission will be considered for evaluation.
Now, I will begin working on the React version of this project.
